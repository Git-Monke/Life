Project Objective

The goal of this game is to provide an interesting programming challenge to those who want one.
Many programmers love to automate games, but few multiplayer games allow this form of automation
This game can only be played through bots, and it is all played on the same server.
This will create incredible competition between those trying to play the game, as there is no limit on the complexity of the bots the users create

The design of the world and how the creatures interact with it should be incredibly modular. The actual data structures should be very simple and flexible, allowing for many features to be added. Similar to dwarf fortress.

Basic game functionality:
  1. When a user logs in, if they have no registered organisms they can send a request to create one 
  2. Every organism has a few core traits:
    a. List of senses,
    b. List of whitelisted instructions,
    c. Size
    d. Brain Size
    e. Brain Speed
  3. Based on these core traits, each organism has a Basal Metabolic Rate. Every game tick, the organism loses energy based on this value 
  4. If any organism loses all of its energy, it dies and this turns into food 
  5. Larger organisms can move on top of smaller organisms. Smaller and equal sized organisms cannot overlap. If a larger organism overlaps more than half with an organism smaller than itself (that isn't of the same race), the smaller organism will die and turn into food
